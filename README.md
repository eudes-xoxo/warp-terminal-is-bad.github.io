## Your terminal shouldn't be nonfree.

Your terminal is the most important part of your personal Operating System. You should be able to have the freedom to modify it, redistribute it, and look at the source code.

Warp Terminal is proprietary software, it is closed-source. You cannot modify it to your needs, neither can you redistribute it.

This is a step backward in terminal emulation. Many former closed-source terminal emulators like [conhost.exe have been open-sourced](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal), yet Warp Terminal remains proprietary.

Even with the Warp Terminal team considering open sourcing parts of the code, that would still not be the full code, which makes Warp Terminal remain nonfree.

## ~~Your terminal shouldn't be a web app.~~

~~Warp Terminal is built with Electron, the worst possible framework for a terminal emulator. It is slow, it is bloated, and it is not designed for the task. There are multiple other things that Electron is actually suited for, and this is not one of them.~~

> EDIT (May 9, 2025): I was wrong about this. Warp Terminal is built with Rust, not Electron.

## Why is this a problem?

Nonfree terminal emulators undermine computing freedom and shrink the pool of community-driven alternatives.

## A message to the Warp Terminal team.

This is not a personal attack, but please stop. If you made this proprietary for profit, remember you can charge as much as you wish for free software.

~~Even if this does become free software, my point still remains. Electron is too slow and bloated for a terminal emulator, and this is not good for the future of computing.~~
